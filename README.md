# Fraud-Detection-Analytics

# Motivation
One thing that smart businesses have in common is that they adopt the proactive approach instead of the reactive. Gone are the days when setting up a speedy customer redressal process for fraudulent online transactions was enough. Why not prevent these transactions before they occur in real-time?
If hosted and productized, a smart fraud detection system could help online businesses save millions of dollars incurred as fraud losses. Essentially, the higher the accuracy of our model, the lower the business cost.

# Data
We used the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection data set hosted by Vesta.

# Approach
1) Exploratory data analysis and visualizations. Engineered Features after understanding the data.
2) Handled missing values, multicollinearity and class imbalance
3) Built Machine Learning models to predict the likelihood of fraud
4) Productization by building a prototype with a front end for our model
